This profile has created a multi-project build where the "server" module contains the Grails application and the "client" module contains the Angular 2 application.

To start the Grails application separately, execute "./gradlew server:bootRun"
To start the client side application separately, execute "./gradlew client:bootRun"

To start both the client and server applications simultaneously, execute "./gradlew bootRun --parallel"
